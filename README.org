Welcome to VivaceGraph, a high-performance, open-source, persistent graph database written entirely in Common Lisp.

VivaceGraph takes design inspiration from CouchDB, Neo4j, and AllegroGraph. It provides a native Lisp environment for modeling, storing, and querying highly connected data, treating graph elements (vertices and edges) as first-class CLOS objects.

* Key Features

- *Persistent On-Disk Storage:* Uses memory-mapped files to handle graphs larger than available RAM and ensure data durability.
- *ACID Transactions:* Guarantees atomicity and consistency for all database modifications via a transaction manager.
- *Native Lisp Object Model:* Define your graph schema with standard CLOS classes. No Object-Graph Mapper (OGM) needed.
- *Prolog-based Query Language:* A powerful, declarative query language embedded directly in Lisp for expressive pattern matching and graph traversal.
- *High-Performance Indexing:* Create secondary indexes ("views") on any node property for fast lookups. Supports map-reduce views for real-time data aggregation.
- *Master-Slave Replication:* Built-in asynchronous replication for high availability and horizontal read scaling.
- *Concurrency Control:* Fine-grained read-write locks to ensure thread-safe operations.

* Project Status & Important Announcements

This project was created and is primarily maintained by Kevin Raison.

- *Call for Contributors (2024):* The author is currently volunteering in Ukraine and is actively seeking help to maintain and improve this codebase. If you are interested in contributing, please see the "Contributing" section below.

- *Breaking Changes (Dec 2016):* A significant performance improvement was made to the hashing scheme for nodes and indexes. *This change is not backward-compatible.* If you have a VivaceGraph database created before this change (commit ~58f87d60~), you *must* back it up using the ~snapshot~ function and restore it into a new, empty graph using ~replay~. This one-time migration will yield dramatic performance improvements on large graphs.

* Installation

VivaceGraph is not yet available in the main Quicklisp distribution. You must install it from the git repository.

*** Prerequisites: Supported Lisp Implementations

Before installing, please ensure you are using one of the following supported Common Lisp implementations. VivaceGraph relies on specific features of these implementations for its concurrency, memory-mapping, and object system integration.

- *SBCL* (version 1.0.45 or newer)
- *LispWorks*
- *Clozure CL (CCL)*

An experimental port for ECL exists in a separate branch (~ecl-port~). Porting to other modern Common Lisp implementations should be feasible with moderate effort, and contributions are welcome.


*** Method 1: Quicklisp Local-Projects (Recommended)

Clone the repository directly into your Quicklisp `local-projects` directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects/
  git clone https://github.com/kraison/vivace-graph-v3.git
#+END_SRC

After cloning, you can load it like any other Quicklisp library:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload :graph-db)
#+END_SRC

*** Method 2: Roswell

If you use Roswell, you can install it directly from GitHub:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ros install kraison/vivace-graph-v3
#+END_SRC


*** Method 3: Ultralisp

If you have already Quicklisp installed, you can install Ultralisp for it.
Start your SBCL which has Quicklisp already installed and type in:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.ultralisp.org/"
                      :prompt nil) ; => no interactive questions
;; this installs Ultralisp
#+END_SRC
Once, your Quicklisp is Ultralisp-installed, if you do:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ql:quickload :graph-db)
#+END_SRC
The Quicklisp client checks all installed dists and prefers the **newest available version** across them.
This will mostly result in getting a fresher version from the Ultralisp repository.

Useful commands with Ultralisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; which packages are installed?
(ql-dist:all-dists)

;; which dist provides a certain system?
(ql-where-is :graph-db)

;; update ultralisp metadata (not often needed)
(ql:update-dist :ultralisp)

;; update all dists including Quicklisp itself
(ql:update-all-dists)

;; uninstall a dist including ultralisp
(ql-dist:uninstall-dist "ultralisp")
#+END_SRC


* Quick Start: Your First Graph Application

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get up and running. We'll model a simple social network where users can follow each other.

*** 1. Define Your Schema

First, we describe the structure of our data using ~def-vertex~ and ~def-edge~. We'll associate our schema with a graph named ~:social-app~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defpackage #:my-app (:use #:cl #:graph-db))
  (in-package #:my-app)
  
  ;; Define a 'user' vertex with a 'username' property.
  (def-vertex user ()
    ((username :type string))
    :social-app)
  
  ;; Define a directed 'follows' edge.
  (def-edge follows ()
    ()
    :social-app)
#+END_SRC

*** 2. Connect to the Database

Next, create or open a graph instance. The special variable ~*graph*~ must be bound to your active graph.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defvar *graph*
    (make-graph :social-app "/var/tmp/social-app/"))

  ;; When your application exits, always close the graph cleanly.
  ;; (close-graph *graph*)
#+END_SRC

*** 3. Create Data (Inside a Transaction)

All database writes *must* happen inside a ~with-transaction~ block to ensure data consistency.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (with-transaction ()
    (let ((alice (make-user :username "alice"))
          (bob   (make-user :username "bob"))
          (carol (make-user :username "carol")))
      
      ;; Alice follows Bob and Carol.
      (make-follows :from alice :to bob)
      (make-follows :from alice :to carol)))
#+END_SRC

*** 4. Index Your Data for Fast Lookups

To find nodes by their properties (like username), you need to create a *view*. A view is a secondary index that makes lookups fast.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; Create a view to index users by their username.
  (def-view user-by-username :lessp (user :social-app)
    (:map
     (lambda (user-node)
       (yield (username user-node) nil))))

  ;; Now you can query the view to find a user.
  (defun find-user (username)
    (let ((result (invoke-graph-view 'user 'user-by-username :key username)))
      (when result
        (lookup-vertex (cdr (assoc :id (first result)))))))

  (let ((bob (find-user "bob")))
    (format t "Found user: ~a~%" (username bob)))
#+END_SRC

*** 5. Query Relationships

This is the core power of a graph database. Let's find out who Alice follows using VivaceGraph's declarative Prolog-style query language.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (let ((alice (find-user "alice")))
    ;; The query needs access to the Lisp variable `alice`.
    (declare (special alice))
    
    (select-flat (?friend-name)
      ;; Goal 1: Import the 'alice' Lisp object into the query.
      (lisp ?alice-node alice)

      ;; Goal 2: Find any node `?friend` connected by a `follows` edge.
      (follows ?alice-node ?friend)

      ;; Goal 3: Get the username of that friend.
      (node-slot-value ?friend username ?friend-name)))
#+END_SRC
The above query will return: `("bob" "carol")`

* Why VivaceGraph?

Choose VivaceGraph when the *relationships, paths, and patterns* in your data are just as important as the data itself.

- *vs. Relational DBs:* VivaceGraph avoids expensive, multi-table `JOIN` operations. Traversing relationships is a fast, native operation.
- *vs. Document/Key-Value Stores:* VivaceGraph makes relationships first-class citizens, unlike document stores where connections between entities are difficult to model and query efficiently.

* Further Learning

The best next step is to read the included ~example.lisp~ file. It provides a more comprehensive demonstration of the database's features, including map-reduce views and more complex queries.

* Contributing

VivaceGraph is looking for contributors to help with maintenance, documentation, and feature development. If you are interested in getting involved with a unique, high-performance Lisp project, please contact Kevin Raison at *kevin@chatsubolabs.com*.
